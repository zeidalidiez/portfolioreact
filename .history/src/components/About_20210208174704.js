      <h2>About Zeid</h2>

      <p>With prior experience in tech project management as well as IT, I specialize in bridging the communication gap between experts and end-users, taking charge of seeing a project to completion from the very beginning, engaging in thorough research and performing logical checks and tests along the way - all while maintaining an open line of communication with my superior on the status and expected outcomes of all current projects. </p>

      <p>I love learning and seeking new experiences. Years as a program administrator for a large telecom company eventually led me to the field of IT, in which I developed the skills to track and execute complex projects. I further refined my project managing abilities while interning at a tech focused advertising company, where I increased my knowledge and abilities of timekeeping, scheduling and project management immensely.</p>
      <p>I'm Located in Auburn, WA - close to both Seattle and Tacoma. Get in touch with me about how we can work together to build something exciting! </p>



I have spent all of my life fiddling around with scripting as a hobby for various video games and modifications of existing games.

I love to 'take things apart' and figure out how they work - they're all fun logic puzzles. I love thinking of ways to efficiently relay mental models and ideas to others, increasing my team's communication as well as strengthening my own.
